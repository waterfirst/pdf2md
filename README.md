# PDF to Markdown

This application is a tool for uploading PDF files and analyzing their content using Mistral AI's OCR capabilities.

## Getting Mistral AI API Key

1. Access [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) to create an account or log in
2. Generate an API key from the dashboard
3. Store the generated API key securely

## Vercel Blob Setup

Before deploying the application, you need to set up Vercel Blob storage:

1. **Create a Vercel project**

   - Access [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to sign up/log in
   - Click "New Project" to create a new project

2. **Create a Vercel Blob store**

   - Select the "Storage" tab in the project dashboard
   - Click the "Connect Database" button
   - Select "Blob" in the "Create New" tab and click the "Continue" button
   - Configure the following settings:
     - Name: Any name (e.g., "PDF Storage")
     - Select "Create a new Blob store"
     - Select the environments where you want to add environment variables (typically all environments)
     - Optionally change the environment variable prefix in "Advanced Options"
   - Click the "Create" button to create the store

3. **Set up environment variables**

   - When the Blob store is created, the following environment variable will be automatically added to your project:
     - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
   - To use this environment variable in your local development environment, pull the environment variables using Vercel CLI:
     ```bash
     vercel env pull
     ```

Once these settings are complete, you can proceed with deploying the application.

## Deploy on Vercel

Follow these steps to deploy the application on Vercel:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/link2004/pdf2md.git
   cd pdf2md
   ```

2. **Copy the .env.example file**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Set up the required environment variables in the .env file**

   - Get `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` from your Vercel dashboard and set it
   - Get `MISTRAL_API_KEY` from your Mistral AI account and set it

   ```
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
   BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_read_write_token
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**

   - Log in or create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Click on "New Project"
   - Import your repository from GitHub
   - Add the same environment variables as in your `.env` file in the "Environment Variables" section
   - Click on the "Deploy" button

5. **Verify the deployment**
   - Once deployment is complete, access the provided URL to confirm that the application is working properly

Note: Environment variables contain sensitive information, so do not commit your `.env` file to public repositories like GitHub. Instead, set the environment variables directly in the Vercel dashboard.

## Features
